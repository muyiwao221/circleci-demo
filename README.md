Circle CI Technical Challenge - Build and Test.<br />
This is just a simple webpage built with HTML and JavaScript that has a clickable button. When clicked, the button will display a "Thank you for considering my application!" message. Additionally, this is built and tested using CircleCI. This main branch simply runs the build and test without the deploy.
