<h1>Circle CI Demo - Build and Test.</h1><br />
This is just a simple webpage built with HTML and JavaScript that has a clickable button. When clicked, the button will display a "Thank you!!" message. Additionally, this is built and tested using CircleCI. This main branch simply runs the build and test jobs without any deployments.
